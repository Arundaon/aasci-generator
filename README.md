### format   
```python3 main.py [image name] [ratio]```  
ratio means x times the size of the original image  
1 means all of the pixels from the original image, while 0.5 means half of the pixels.  
You can use this to adjust to your terminal, so it will fit the screen perfectly.   
### example  
```python3 main.py monalisa.jpg 0.3```
